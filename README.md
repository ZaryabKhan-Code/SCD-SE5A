## Course Overview

This course aims to provide a **hands-on** and **project-focused** approach to web development using **Python** as the primary language. By the end of the 20 weeks, you will have the confidence to:

- Build and structure a Flask project from scratch
- Work effectively with **templates** (Jinja2) for front-end rendering
- Handle databases using **SQLite** and manage data with **Flask-SQLAlchemy**
- Implement features like user authentication, session management, and role-based access
- Incorporate industry-standard practices such as **testing**, **logging**, **error handling**, **caching**, and **deployment**
